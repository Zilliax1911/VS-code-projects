## what is a life hack that is so simple yet so effective,you are shocked more people dont know about it?

- If you got something that comes with a unique charger/power cable,label it with what it is for.
- when looking at recipes online, click the print link. This cuts out the unnecessary backstory and random musings. You can also save the recipe as a PDF to your computer or even just the link to the printable version.
- Create a routine for BEFORE exercise. I do the exact same things every time i go to the gym. When IM not motivated, those little pre workout habits just trigger me into action.
- To increase your peace of mind dont waste your time arguing with random strangers on internet.
- Always write down momentarily good ideas. Dont lean on your memory.
- If you re making coffee in an automatic drip coffee maker, especially a cheap one, leaving a little bit of water in the carafe (about an ounce ir so)will signigicantly improve the falvor. It prevents the first bit of brewed coffee from becoming scorched from the hot plate and flavoring the entire pot.
- From working technical support for longer than I dare think about, most angry customers just want to be heard. Let them have their rant, do active listening, and make notes about what they re saying.
